# Microservice infrastructure

This project contains the generic version of the scripts used to deploy the Medical Informatics Platform.

The platform runs over a [Mesos](http://mesos.apache.org/) cluster and most services are managed by [Marathon](https://mesosphere.github.io/marathon/).

mip-microservices-infrastructure attempts to follow the Mantl.io project from Cisco (https://github.com/CiscoCloud/microservices-infrastructure) but with the following restrictions:

* The deployment target is Ubuntu 16.04 instead of CentOS
* No support for any cloud is provided, we deploy on bare-metal and pre-configured virtual machines
* Security, monitoring are advanced features that we may add one day, but what we aim to to is being able to switch over to Mantl once it is sufficiently stable.

Disclaimer: use this project only in a well protected development environment.
